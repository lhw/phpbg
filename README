[new in this version]
	* object based
	* using XML for some half-static data (buildings,units,...)
	* filesystem hierarchy changed
	* using plugins for almost all features
	* changed license from GPLv2 to GPLv3
	* new devolper: Lennart Weller (cyfreeze)
	* new graphic designer - {Graphic_Designer}

[object based]
phpBG will now base on objects. The core objects will be found in the "system"
dir. The following things are supposed to be "core"-objects:
	* database
	* template
	* mailing
	* plugins
	* ...

[plugin based]
phpBG will move a lot of features into plugins. For example the news section
will be a (default) plugin. If you don't like it you can just remove the plugin
and live without it. If you want more features - just search for a plugin. The
default plugins will be:

Plugin -> User -> Highscore
Plugin -> User -> Messages
Plugin -> User -> Clan
Plugin -> User -> Stats (was "My Land")
Plugin -> User -> Buildings

Plugin -> Admin -> News
Plugin -> Admin -> Clan
Plugin -> Admin -> Message
Plugin -> Admin -> Era
Plugin -> Admin -> User
Plugin -> Admin -> Language
Plugin -> Admin -> Building
Plugin -> Admin -> Design
Plugin -> Admin -> Game Info
Plugin -> Admin -> Plugins
Plugin -> Admin -> Ressources

Instance -> Building -> Common -> House
Instance -> Building -> Common -> Warehouse
Instance -> Building -> Common -> Town Center
Instance -> Building -> Common -> Market Place
Instance -> Building -> Research -> School
Instance -> Building -> Research -> Laboratory
Instance -> Building -> Research -> Commando Center
Instance -> Building -> Research -> Defensive Center
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Lumbercamp
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Stonemason
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Goldsmith
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Fields
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Ironsmith
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Oil Refinery
Instance -> Building -> Ressources -> Generator
Instance -> Building -> War -> Weaponry
Instance -> Building -> War -> Barracks
Instance -> Building -> War -> Factory
Instance -> Building -> War -> Port
Instance -> Building -> War -> Airport

every plugin consists of a php class with the code and a XML file,
which contains information about the plugin, for example its dependencies.

[Admin Plugins]
Due to the change, that half-static data will be put into
data->xml->*.xml the admin plugins need write access to
this file. If they don't have write access they will give
you the chance to download the new file, so that you can
upload the new file yourself.


[Design]
There will be 3 Designtemplates for each Design, now. One for the non-logged-in
part, one for the normal playing part and last but not least one for the admin
area. The new admin area is supposed to change the navigation completly.
Similar like this:

+------------------------------+		+-------------------------+
| back to Player View          |		| News                    |
| Clan Configuration           |		| Statistics              |
| User Configuration           |		| ...                     |
| ...                          |		| Admin Panel             |
+------------------------------+		+-------------------------+

[Home Text]
The text displayed on the home-page (in non-logged in modus) will now be in a
*.txt file. This file will be home.en.txt home.de.txt - one for each language
the game is supposed to support.
