[new in this version]
	* object based
	* using XML for some half-static data (buildings,units,...)
	* filesystem hierarchy changed
	* using plugins for almost all features
	* changed license from GPLv2 to GPLv3
	* new devolper: Lennart Weller (cyfreeze)
	* new graphic designer - {Graphic_Designer}

[object based]
phpBG will now base on objects. The core objects will be found in the "system"
dir. The following things are supposed to be "core"-objects:
	* database
	* template
	* mailing
	* plugins
	* ...

[plugin based]
phpBG will move a lot of features into plugins. For example the news section
will be a (default) plugin. If you don't like it you can just remove the plugin
and live without it. If you want more features - just search for a plugin. The
default plugins will be:

Plugin -> User -> Highscore
Plugin -> User -> Messages
Plugin -> User -> Clan
Plugin -> User -> Stats (was "My Land")
Plugin -> User -> Buildings

Plugin -> Admin -> News
Plugin -> Admin -> Clan
Plugin -> Admin -> Message
Plugin -> Admin -> Era
Plugin -> Admin -> User
Plugin -> Admin -> Language
Plugin -> Admin -> Building
Plugin -> Admin -> Design
Plugin -> Admin -> Game Info
Plugin -> Admin -> Plugins
Plugin -> Admin -> Ressources

Plugin -> Building -> Common -> House
Plugin -> Building -> Common -> Warehouse
Plugin -> Building -> Common -> Town Center
Plugin -> Building -> Common -> Market Place
Plugin -> Building -> Research -> School
Plugin -> Building -> Research -> Laboratory
Plugin -> Building -> Research -> Commando Center
Plugin -> Building -> Research -> Defensive Center
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Lumbercamp
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Stonemason
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Goldsmith
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Fields
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Ironsmith
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Oil Refinery
Plugin -> Building -> Ressources -> Generator
Plugin -> Building -> War -> Weaponry
Plugin -> Building -> War -> Barracks
Plugin -> Building -> War -> Factory
Plugin -> Building -> War -> Port
Plugin -> Building -> War -> Airport

every plugin consists of a php class with the code and a XML file,
which contains information about the plugin, for example its dependencies.

[Admin Plugins]
Due to the change, that half-static data will be put into
data->xml->*.xml the admin plugins need write access to
this file. If they don't have write access they will give
you the chance to download the new file, so that you can
upload the new file yourself.
